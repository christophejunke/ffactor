=========

- The KMP table computation can be linear instead of quadratic
- It may be a good idea to abstract KMP to ff_kmp
- Write unit tests (soundness and performance)
- Do not use fread and fwrite but buffered read and write
- Warn when a key is redefined or used when undefined
- Add a weak set/unset to remove the first warning
