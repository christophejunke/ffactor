- Lines starting with a dash and a space are ignored.
- Empty lines are ignored too.

- You may set a key using the 'set' command:
set vim

if vim
- We enter this branch since 'vim' is set.
else
- This branch is skipped.
endif

- Here is the general structure of branching commands:
- if <c-0>
- [... executed if <c-0> is true ...]
- elif <c-1>
- [... executed if <c-0> was false and <c-1> is true ...]
- elif <c-2>
- [...]
- elif <c-N>
- [...]
- else
- [... executed if <c-0> through <c-N> were false ...]
- endif

if emacs
- We skip this branch since 'emacs' is not set.
elif vim
- We enter this branch since 'emacs' is not set and 'vim' is.
else
- We skip this branch since one previous branch was taken.
endif

- Here are possible conditions to be used in branching commands:
- 0 is false
- 1 is true
- (not <c>) is true iff <c> is false
- (and <c-0> [...] <c-N>) is true iff <c-0> through <c-N> are true
- (or <c-0> [...] <c-N>) is false iff <c-0> through <c-N> are false
- <key> is true iff <key> is set

if (and emacs vim)
- We skip this branch.
elif (or emacs vim)
- We enter this branch.
endif

if (not emacs)
- We enter this branch.
endif

- You may use the 'error' command to ensure that some condition holds.
if (not (or emacs vim))
error At least one editor should be set.
endif
